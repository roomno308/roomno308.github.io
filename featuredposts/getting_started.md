For featuring your post in the featured column of room no. 308, you need to make a pull request to the [repository](https://github.com/roomno308/roomno308.github.io).

- The `.md` file for your post should reside inside the folder `/featuredposts/`.
- Add the following YAML front matter to the top of your markdown file:
```

layout: Post
title: <Your title>
author: <your name>

```
- Add an entry for your post in the file `posts.md`. The entry should be a list item having the title and name of the file as `[Title](filename)`.
