"This book took my brain apart and rebuilt it."

"Best book on statistics ever."

These are some of the reviews taken from the comment section of google goodreads. Now, I must admit that I am not that well trained in mathematics to represent the book to it full potential. However, I will try my best not to misrepresent it, and convey its most important parts to the best of my ability.
